In this semester's project, we have successfully developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**-based model for the precise segmentation of the sclera. This project represents a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence, as it marks my inaugural endeavor within this domain. The model, which operates as a Supervised Learning Model for Semantic Segmentation, has achieved an impressive accuracy of 90%. The project relied on the utilization of the **SBVPI Dataset** as the primary dataset for training and validation. Additionally, presented a paper on the same in the conference.
