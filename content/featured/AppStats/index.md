Access the reports of reviews, installs, ratings, store performance & crashes with your system(API + Badge for GitHub readme file). Since no official API exists for retrieving published app reports from Google Play Console, decided to create one for myself. For this implementation, we have focused only on the installs/downloads report of the app using Flask+Vercel. Also wrote it in a step-by-step guide on Medium. For reading that article click on **Learn More**. Last but not least it's developed using all free resources.
