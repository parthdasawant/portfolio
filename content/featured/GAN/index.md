The web app, sponsored by **Neurodynamics Research Labs Pvt. Ltd.**, has developed a user-friendly Flask-based website that leverages **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)** to instantly convert images into realistic pencil sketches. This website utilizes a model which is train by us on Kaggle, ensuring high-quality sketch generation. Users can easily upload images, customize sketches, and download the results, offering a seamless and accessible platform for creating pencil sketches.
